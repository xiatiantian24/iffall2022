        <p>This rich and fragrant chicken stew is laden with complex flavors and spices reminiscent of the sort you
            might encounter in a mountainside cafe in Morocco. Save yourself the cost of a plane ticket, however, and
            make this at home.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix garlic, saffron, ginger, paprika, cumin and turmeric together. If not using kosher chicken, add ½
                teaspoon salt. Add pepper to taste. Rub chicken with mixture, cover, refrigerate and marinate 3 to 4
                hours.<img src="https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/4Jr-PmSYr0NdyXkpdNVPu7Jb4kE=/580x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/chicken-tagine-with-preserved-lemons-olives-2394715-step-01-4092827c94f64240ba7637ff4ee808ab.jpg"><img src="https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/1pgGL18MNw4zn9Es1cxYruEXeaI=/580x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/chicken-tagine-with-preserved-lemons-olives-2394715-step-04-33c43c9b9bc24c968b63e5848a622ca9.jpg"></li>
            <li>Heat oil in heavy skillet. Add chicken, and brown on all sides. Remove to platter. Add onions to
                skillet, and cook over medium-low heat about 15 minutes, until lightly browned. Transfer to tagine, if
                you are using one, or leave in skillet. Add cinnamon stick.</li>
            <li>Put chicken on onions. Scatter with olives. Quarter the lemons, remove pulp and cut skin in strips.
                Scatter over chicken. Mix stock and lemon juice. Pour over chicken.<img src="https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/RYUfy3_Ut1SOGXdyng7vqQY6Ssw=/580x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/chicken-tagine-with-preserved-lemons-olives-2394715-step-03-459f6be05d354b0b87e682c08cc30ab2.jpg"></li>
            <li>Cover tagine or skillet. Place over low heat, and cook about 30 minutes, until chicken is done. Scatter
                parsley on top, and serve.<img src="https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/5FQXsG1f6mBS7Phzk5DOCIcK24Y=/580x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/chicken-tagine-with-preserved-lemons-olives-2394715-step-06-493352800d56492b8a621dc49fdc9ae3.jpg"></li>

        <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
        <p><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">NYT Cooking</a> does a good job in breaking their
            contents into columns. User experience wise, the website makes it easier for user to shop ingredients by
            having the 'add ingredients to your grocery' and 'ingredient substitution guide' buttons.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.delish.com/" target="_blank">Delish</a> has clear navigations throughout their website. Each recipe contains a hamburger menu where users can click back to the parant page. There is also a top nav bar to help navigate through the site.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food" target="_blank">BBC Food</a> makes each ingredient a hyperlink that links to a collection page of all recipes made with that ingredient. There is also a separated column on the right of the page to suggest similar recipes.</p>
        <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
        <p><a href="https://eternalexplorer.me/" target="_blank">Eternal Explorer</a> is a great example of website with serif fonts. The visual hierarchy of different titles and the inclusion of article labels make it super appealing to read.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.ferrari.com/en-US" target="_blank">Ferrari</a> has a cool landing animation & scrolling effect on their home page. It makes users pay more attention (and anticipation) to the contents coming up in the page.</p> 
        <p><a href="https://nymag.com/" target="_blank">New York Magazine</a> features articles that visually resembles columns from newspapers. I like how the image are aligned and in good ratio with the texts.</p>
