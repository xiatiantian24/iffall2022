        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>I'm Ray Xia and I am a junior at WashU studying Communication Design with a minor in Human Computer Interactino.</li>
            <li>Working with web format is essential to an interaction deisgner so I wish to learn the basic skills I need and see what intersts me the most.</li>
            <li>I kind of learned HTML and CSS on the job I had for intern, but I have zero experience in JS. I'm excited to learn it!</li>
            <li>I'm exicted to learn how to use JS to make page transition animation and integrate it to my website.</li>
            <li>I think desiging on screen in general requires more white space than on a piece of paper because information is supported with more interactive components such as links, images, etc.</li>
            <li>The design of <a href="https://www.adobe.com/" title="adobe.com" target="_blank"> Adobe </a> is always appealing to me because it integrates gif/video into their pages with limited text to make the site more visually dynamic.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/" title="awwwards.com" target="_blank"> Awwwards </a> is a display website of designs from other designers but the website itself also communicates a lot of information successfully through design. The header features the site of the day while action buttons and information about the design is overlayed on top of the cover image. Also, each project underneath presented on the main page contains labels distinct by colors, which are easy to scan through and find targeting information.</li>
            <li>I found <a href="https://codepen.io/" title="codepen.io" target="_blank"> Codepen </a> works extremely well when I wish to update my code and see live changes. It also breaks up HTML, CSS, and JS into three columns for you to edit separately. There is low user friction when I'm using this site. Plus, it's free! </li>
