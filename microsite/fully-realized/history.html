                    <h4>Babylon</h4>
                    <p>
                        By the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, the Babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated base 60
                        positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a space
                        between
                        sexagesimal numerals. In a tablet unearthed at Kish (dating to as early as 700 BC), the scribe
                        Bêl-bân-aplu used three hooks as a placeholder in the same Babylonian system. By 300 BC, a
                        punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted to serve as this placeholder.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone, nor was it used at
                        the
                        end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60), 3 and 180 (3×60), 4 and 240 (4×60) looked
                        the
                        same, because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. Only context could
                        differentiate them.</p>

                <div id="maya">
                    <h4>Maya</h4>
                    <p>It is generally
                        believed
                        that the use of zero in the Americas predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the
                        Olmecs.
                        Many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland, although the Olmec
                        civilization ended by the 4th century BC, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count
                        dates.</p>
                    <p>
                        Although zero became an integral part of Maya numerals, with a different, empty tortoise-like
                        "shell
                        shape" used for many depictions of the "zero" numeral, it is assumed not to have influenced Old
                        World numeral systems.</p>

                    <h4>China</h4>
                    <p>The Sūnzĭ Suànjīng, of unknown date but estimated to be dated from the 1st to 5th centuries AD,
                        and
                        Japanese records dated from the 18th century, describe how the c. 4th century BC Chinese
                        counting
                        rods system enabled one to perform decimal calculations. As noted in Xiahou Yang's Suanjing
                        (425–468
                        AD) that states that to multiply or divide a number by 10, 100, 1000, or 10000, all one needs to
                        do,
                        with rods on the counting board, is to move them forwards, or back, by 1, 2, 3, or 4 places,
                        According to A History of Mathematics, the rods "gave the decimal representation of a number,
                        with
                        an empty space denoting zero". The counting rod system is considered a positional notation
                        system.</p>
                    <p>
                        Zero was not treated as a number at that time, but as a "vacant position". Qín Jiǔsháo's
                        1247
                        Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections is the oldest surviving Chinese mathematical text using a
                        round symbol for zero. Chinese authors had been familiar with the idea of negative numbers
                        by
                        the Han Dynasty (2nd century AD), as seen in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art.</p>

                    <h4>India</h4>
                    <p>The concept of zero as a written digit in the decimal place value notation was developed in
                        India. A symbol for zero, a large dot likely to be the precursor of the still-current hollow
                        symbol, is used throughout the Bakhshali manuscript, a practical manual on arithmetic for
                        merchants. It is known as South
                        Asia's
                        oldest recorded use of the zero symbol.</p>

                    <p>A black dot is used as a decimal placeholder in the Bakhshali manuscript, portions of which date
                        from
                        AD 224–993.

                        There are numerous copper plate inscriptions, with the same small o in them, some of them
                        possibly
                        dated to the 6th century, but their date or authenticity may be open to doubt.

                        A stone tablet found in the ruins of a temple near Sambor on the Mekong, Kratié Province,
                        Cambodia,
                        includes the inscription of "605" in Khmer numerals (a set of numeral glyphs for the
                        Hindu–Arabic
                        numeral system). The number is the year of the inscription in the Saka era, corresponding to a
                        date
                        of AD 683.

                        The first known use of special glyphs for the decimal digits that includes the indubitable
                        appearance of a symbol for the digit zero, a small circle, appears on a stone inscription found
                        at
                        the Chaturbhuj Temple, Gwalior, in India, dated 876.</p>
