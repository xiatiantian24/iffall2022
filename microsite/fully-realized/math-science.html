                    <h4>Mathematics</h4>
                    <p>The number 0 is the smallest non-negative integer. The natural number following 0 is 1 and no
                        natural number precedes 0. The number 0 may or may not be considered a natural number, but it is
                        an integer, and hence a rational number and a real number (as well as an algebraic number and a
                        complex number).</p>
                    <img src="img/math-2.png">
                    <p>
                        The number 0 is neither positive nor negative, and is usually displayed as the central number in
                        a number line. It is neither a prime number nor a composite number. It cannot be prime because
                        it has an infinite number of factors, and cannot be composite because it cannot be expressed as
                        a product of prime numbers (as 0 must always be one of the factors). Zero is, however, even
                        (i.e. a multiple of 2, as well as being a multiple of any other integer, rational, or real
                        number).
                    </p>

                    <p>The following are some basic (elementary) rules for dealing with the number 0. These rules apply
                        for any real or complex number x, unless otherwise stated.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Addition: x + 0 = 0 + x = x. That is, 0 is an identity element (or neutral element) with
                            respect to addition.</li>
                        <li>
                            Subtraction: x − 0 = x and 0 − x = −x.</li>
                        <li>Multiplication: x · 0 = 0 · x = 0.</li>
                        <li>Division:
                            0
                            /
                            x
                            = 0, for nonzero x. But
                            x
                            /
                            0
                            is undefined, because 0 has no multiplicative inverse (no real number multiplied by 0
                            produces 1), a
                            consequence of the previous rule.</li>
                        <li>
                            Exponentiation: x0 =
                            x
                            /
                            x
                            = 1, except that the case x = 0 may be left undefined in some contexts. For all positive
                            real x, 0x
                            = 0.
                            The expression
                            0
                            /
                            0
                            , which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form
                            f(x)
                            /
                            g(x)
                            as a result of applying the lim operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is
                            a
                            so-called "indeterminate form". That does not mean that the limit sought is necessarily
                            undefined;
                            rather, it means that the limit of
                            f(x)
                            /
                            g(x)
                            , if it exists, must be found by another method, such as l'Hôpital's rule.

                            The sum of 0 numbers (the empty sum) is 0, and the product of 0 numbers (the empty product)
                            is 1.
                            The factorial 0! evaluates to 1, as a special case of the empty product.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="img/math-3.png">
                    <p>In set theory, 0 is the cardinality of the empty set: if one does not have any apples, then one
                        has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is
                        defined to be the empty set. When this is done, the empty set is the von Neumann cardinal
                        assignment for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. The cardinality function, applied
                        to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.</p>

                    <h4>Physics</h4>
                    <p>The value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. For some quantities, the zero
                        level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less
                        arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an absolute temperature (as measured in kelvins), zero is
                        the lowest possible value (negative temperatures are defined, but negative-temperature systems
                        are not actually colder). This is in contrast to for example temperatures on the Celsius scale,
                        where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. Measuring sound
                        intensity in decibels or phons, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for
                        example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In physics, the zero-point energy is the
                        lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy
                        of the ground state of the system.</p>

                <div id="chemistry">
                    <h4>Chemistry</h4>
                    <p>Zero has been proposed as the atomic number of the theoretical element tetraneutron. It has been
                        shown that a cluster of four neutrons may be stable enough to be considered an atom in its own
                        right. This would create an element with no protons and no charge on its nucleus.

                        As early as 1926, Andreas von Antropoff coined the term neutronium for a conjectured form of
                        matter made up of neutrons with no protons, which he placed as the chemical element of atomic
                        number zero at the head of his new version of the periodic table. It was subsequently placed as
                        a noble gas in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for
                        classifying the chemical elements.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="computer-science">
                    <h4>Computer Science</h4>
                    <p> Zero is the value of false in many programming languages. In binary, 0 represents the value for
                        "off", which means no electricity flow.</p>
                    <p>
                        Many APIs and operating systems that require applications to return an integer value as an exit
                        status typically use zero to indicate success and non-zero values to indicate specific error or
                        warning conditions. Programmers often use a slashed zero to avoid confusion with the letter "O".
                    </p>
                    <p>The most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one. However, in
                        the late 1950s LISP introduced zero-based numbering for arrays while Algol 58 introduced
                        completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero
                        integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or
                        other of these positions. For example, the elements of an array are numbered starting from 0 in
                        C, so that for an array of n items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to n−1. This
                        permits an array element's location to be calculated by adding the index directly to address of
                        the array, whereas 1-based languages precalculate the array's base address to be the position
                        one element before the first.</p>

                <div id="other-fields">
                    <h4>Other Fields</h4>
                    <p>In comparative zoology and cognitive science, recognition that some animals display awareness of
                        the concept of zero leads to the conclusion that the capability for numerical abstraction arose
                        early in the evolution of species.</p>
                    <p>
                        In telephony, pressing 0 is often used for dialling out of a company network or to a different
                        city or region, and 00 is used for dialling abroad. In some countries, dialling 0 places a call
                        for operator assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roulette wheels usually feature a "0" space (and sometimes also a "00" space), whose presence is
                        ignored when calculating payoffs (thereby allowing the house to win in the long run).

                        In Formula One, if the reigning World Champion no longer competes in Formula One in the year
                        following their victory in the title race, 0 is given to one of the drivers of the team that the
                        reigning champion won the title with. This happened in 1993 and 1994, with Damon Hill driving
                        car 0, due to the reigning World Champion (Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost respectively) not
                        competing in the championship.
